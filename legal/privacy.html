        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Granny vs Robot</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

            <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> We track your highest score and maximum wave reached to rank you on the leaderboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> We track if you have opted-in (subscribed) to receive updates or notifications related to the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect passwords, personal email addresses, or any other sensitive personal data outside of what you publicly authorize via Reddit.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>To operate and maintain the game's leaderboard.</li>
            <li>To track your in-game progress (score and waves).</li>
            <li>To send you game updates if you have explicitly subscribed to them.</li>
            <li>To comply with Reddit's Developer Terms and improve overall gameplay experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
